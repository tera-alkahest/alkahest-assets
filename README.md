This repository holds large binary assets for **Alkahest**, such as data center
files. They are stored in the form of releases on the GitHub page.

Users will never need to download anything manually from this repository; the
Alkahest command line interface will handle that.

The [manifest.json](manifest.json) file contains a list of assets along with
checksums for various hash algorithms. See
[manifest.schema.json](manifest.schema.json) for how to interpret the file.

Please do not send pull requests. This repository is maintained by the core
developers.

## Funding

I work on open source software projects such as this one in my spare time, and
make them available free of charge under permissive licenses. If you like my
work and would like to support me, you might consider [sponsoring
me](https://github.com/sponsors/alexrp). Please only donate if you want to and
have the means to do so; I want to be very clear that all open source software I
write will always be available for free and you should not feel obligated to
donate or pay for it in any way.
